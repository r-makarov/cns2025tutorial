# CNS Tutorial: Building Intuitive and Efficient Biophysical Models

This repository contains materials for the tutorial workshop "Building Intuitive and Efficient Biophysical Models" presented at the CNS Conference in Florence, Italy on July 5, 2025.

## Overview

This tutorial focuses on making biophysical models more intuitive and computationally efficient using two new software tools:
- **Jaxley** simulator: A framework for efficient neuronal simulations
- **DendroTweaks** web application: A platform for intuitive parameter tuning

## Workshop Materials

- [Jupyter Notebooks](notebooks/)
